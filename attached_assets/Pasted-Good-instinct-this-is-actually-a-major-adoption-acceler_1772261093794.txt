Good instinct — this is actually a **major adoption accelerator** because it connects your new intelligence layer directly back into the tool brokers already trust and live in every day.

What you want is not just a hyperlink.

You want **context-preserving deep linking into JETNET Evolution** so the user moves seamlessly from:

> AI insight → verified source data → workflow action

Below is the engineering write-up you can hand directly to your team.

---

# EVOLUTION DEEP LINK INTEGRATION

## Hot or Not / Disposition Intelligence Platform

---

# 1. Purpose

Provide a one-tap transition from the Hot/Not mobile app or MCP agent output directly into the corresponding aircraft record inside **JETNET Evolution**.

This achieves three things:

1. Reinforces trust (“show me the source”)
2. Keeps Evolution central to workflow
3. Converts AI insight into operational action

The philosophy:

> AI recommends. Evolution validates and executes.

---

# 2. User Experience (Broker Flow)

### Mobile App

1. Broker enters tail number
2. Receives:

   * Hot/Not score
   * Sell probability
   * AI broker summary
3. User taps:

✅ **“Open in Evolution”**

Phone launches Evolution directly to aircraft profile.

---

### AI Agent (MCP Client)

User asks:

> “Evaluate N123AB.”

Response includes:

```
HOT (82)
Likely to sell within 9–18 months.

Open in JETNET Evolution →
```

Clickable deep link opens Evolution web session.

---

# 3. Deep Link Strategy

You must support TWO scenarios:

## A. Web Evolution (Primary)

Most reliable.

Pattern:

```id="evo1"
https://evolution.jetnet.com/aircraft/{aircraftId}
```

(or equivalent internal route depending on tenant routing)

### Why aircraftId (NOT registration)

* Registrations change
* AircraftID is canonical join key
* Matches Golden Path architecture

Your backend already retrieves this during lookup.

---

## B. Mobile Browser Handoff

If Evolution mobile app exists or future wrapper:

```id="evo2"
jetnetevolution://aircraft/{aircraftId}
```

Fallback:

* If scheme unavailable → open web URL.

---

# 4. Backend Implementation

## Add to AircraftProfile Response

Extend normalized object:

```json id="evo3"
{
  "aircraftId": 123456,
  "registration": "N123AB",
  "evolutionLink": "https://evolution.jetnet.com/aircraft/123456"
}
```

Generated server-side only.

---

## Service Function

Create:

```
/services/evolutionLinkBuilder.ts
```

Logic:

```ts
export function buildEvolutionLink(aircraftId: number) {
  return `${EVOLUTION_BASE_URL}/aircraft/${aircraftId}`;
}
```

Environment variable:

```
EVOLUTION_BASE_URL
```

Allows staging vs production.

---

# 5. MCP Tool Enhancement

Update outputs for:

### `jet_profile_by_registration`

### `hot_or_not_by_registration`

### `predict_owner_disposition`

Add:

```json id="evo4"
"evolutionLink": "https://evolution.jetnet.com/aircraft/123456"
```

Agents will automatically render this as actionable navigation.

---

# 6. AI Prompt Enhancement

Add instruction inside broker summary prompt:

> If an evolutionLink is present, include a short closing sentence directing the user to verify details in Evolution.

Example output:

> Full ownership and transactional validation can be reviewed directly in Evolution.

---

# 7. Security Considerations

Important:

✅ DO:

* Link only using aircraftId
* Require user to already be authenticated in Evolution
* Allow Evolution login redirect if session expired

❌ DO NOT:

* Pass auth tokens
* Embed credentials
* Attempt SSO spoofing

Evolution remains authority.

---

# 8. UX Placement (Apple-Style)

Placement matters.

### Aircraft Header Card

```
N123AB
Gulfstream G650ER
HOT • 82
────────────────────
Open in Evolution →
```

Design rules:

* subtle chevron
* system blue accent
* no heavy button styling
* feels native, not promotional

---

# 9. Strategic Outcome

This integration does something important internally:

Hot/Not does NOT compete with Evolution.

It becomes:

```
Discovery + Intelligence Layer
            ↓
      Evolution Execution Layer
```

You are extending Evolution’s reach rather than replacing it.

---

# 10. Future Enhancements (Phase 2)

Once stable:

### A. Context Return Link

Evolution launches Hot/Not with:

```
hotornot://aircraft/{aircraftId}
```

### B. CRM Jump

From Hot/Not:

* Open Salesforce record
* Open broker pipeline
* Launch outreach workflow

### C. “Why Now?” Banner Inside Evolution

Eventually surfaced natively.

---

# 11. Engineering Tasks Summary

1. Add `evolutionLinkBuilder`
2. Extend normalized aircraft profile
3. Inject link into MCP outputs
4. Add UI header action
5. Update AI summary template
6. Add environment config support

---

## Why this is bigger than it looks

Without this link:
Hot/Not feels experimental.

With this link:
Hot/Not feels like **Evolution’s intelligence engine**.

That psychological shift dramatically increases internal acceptance.

If you want next, I’ll show you the **one feature that will make Evolution users instantly addicted** to this system — something brokers will check every morning without being asked.
