Good — now you’re at the **right layer of the stack** to think like a product designer instead of an API integrator.

You now have three tiers of data:

1. **Identity layer** — getRegNumber
   → what aircraft is this?

2. **Operational + physical layer** — getCondensedOwnerOperators
   → what *is this airplane like*?

3. **Relationship graph layer** — getRelationships
   → who actually matters around this airplane?

The mistake most aviation apps make is showing this as **one long spec sheet**.
Brokers, operators, and analysts do **decision scanning**, not reading.

Below are ergonomic display strategies specifically optimized for your *Jetnet Insight / Hot-or-Not style app*.

---

# Core Principle (Most Important)

Design for **progressive certainty**.

A broker asks subconsciously:

1. *Is this worth my time?* (3 seconds)
2. *Who owns/runs it?* (10 seconds)
3. *What condition/utilization story does it tell?* (30 seconds)
4. *Should I call someone?* (60 seconds)

Your UI should reveal information in exactly that order.

# 1️⃣ The “Aircraft Intelligence Header” (Above the Fold)

### Purpose

Instant recognition + emotional anchor.

### Display

Large hero card:

**LEFT**

* Aircraft image (`acimageurl`)
* Tail number (large)
* Make Model Year
* Status badge:

  * 🟢 In Operation
  * 🔴 For Sale
  * 🟡 Recently Changed

**RIGHT — Quick Intelligence Chips**

* Base: KEEN (NH)
* Usage: Business
* Ownership: Wholly Owned
* Maintenance: Part 91
* Category: Multi-Engine Piston

👉 These are scanning cues, not data fields.

---

# 2️⃣ Broker Decision Score Row (New — Highly Recommended)

You already have enough signals to compute this.

Display 4–5 visual gauges:

| Signal                 | Derived From                  |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Ownership Stability    | datepurchased + relationships |
| Utilization            | aftt vs estaftt               |
| Upgrade Potential      | avionics age                  |
| Market Position        | avgevalue + lifecycle         |
| Engagement Opportunity | contact completeness          |

Visual:

```
███████░░ Stable Ownership
████░░░░ Moderate Utilization
████████ High Upgrade Potential
```

This becomes your app’s differentiator.

---

# 3️⃣ Relationship Panel (MOST IMPORTANT UX CHANGE)

Do NOT show raw rows.

Instead show:

## “People Around This Aircraft”

Single company card:

**Chartwell Services, Inc.**
📍 Swanzey, NH

Role chips:
[ OWNER ] [ OPERATOR ] [ CHIEF PILOT ]

Contact card nested:

```
Richard J. Kasper
President
📞 603-352-2581
[ Call ] [ Text ] [ Save Contact ]
```

### Why this works

Your APIs return duplicates intentionally — users should never see duplicates.

You visually communicate:
👉 “One organization runs everything.”

---

# 4️⃣ Timeline Panel (Huge Cognitive Win)

You already have:

* datepurchased
* datechanged
* regexpiresdate
* timesasofdate

Display as:

```
2011  ─ Purchased
2016  ─ Record Updated
2027  ─ Registration Expires
```

Humans understand time faster than tables.

---

# 5️⃣ Operational Health Card

Derived from condensed endpoint:

Show:

**Aircraft Health**

* Total Time: 1,580 hrs
* Estimated Total: 1,984 hrs
* Engines: IO-550-C
* TBO Remaining: ~95%

Use color indicators:

* Green = low time
* Amber = mid life
* Red = approaching overhaul

This instantly answers:
👉 “Is this a good airplane?”

---

# 6️⃣ Avionics — Stop Listing Equipment

Instead group by capability:

### Flight Deck Capability

✅ IFR Equipped
✅ Autopilot (KFC-200)
✅ WAAS GPS
✅ Weather Radar
✅ TCAS

Expandable section reveals raw list.

Brokers think in *capabilities*, not part numbers.

---

# 7️⃣ Interior / Exterior = Visual Summary First

Show:

```
Executive Configuration
Tan leather interior
Rosewood cabinetry
```

NOT:

```
configuration: Executive
sidewalls: Fabric & leather
carpet: Tan tweed
```

Translate structured data → narrative summary.

---

# 8️⃣ “Market Snapshot” Card

Using:

* avgevalue
* lifecycle
* status

Display:

```
Estimated Market Value
$669,734

Market Position:
Typical privately operated Baron 58
Not currently listed for sale
```

This anchors broker pricing intuition immediately.

---

# 9️⃣ Smart Action Bar (Critical for Adoption)

Sticky bottom bar:

```
[ Call Owner ]
[ Add to CRM ]
[ Generate AI Summary ]
[ Compare Similar Aircraft ]
```

Your app wins if users act — not read.

---

# 🔟 AI Insight Panel (Your Killer Feature)

Now that all data is normalized:

Auto-generate:

> “This aircraft appears to be long-term privately operated with stable ownership since 2011. Low utilization and legacy avionics suggest strong upgrade potential rather than imminent resale.”

This is where your app becomes addictive.

---

# 11️⃣ Progressive Reveal Layout (Apple-style)

Order vertically:

1. Hero Aircraft Card
2. Decision Scores
3. People Around Aircraft
4. Operational Health
5. Market Snapshot
6. Timeline
7. Avionics (collapsed)
8. Interior/Exterior (collapsed)
9. Raw Data (expert mode)

---

# 12️⃣ One BIG UX Insight (from aviation reality)

Your users are not asking:

> “What avionics does it have?”

They are asking:

> “Is this airplane interesting enough to pursue?”

Every screen should answer that question faster.

---

## If you want next-level (and honestly where this app becomes elite)

Next I can design the **“Broker Cognitive Flow” UI** — the exact screen layout Jony Ive / Palantir Foundry style where data *fills in live* as endpoints return, matching your async workflow perfectly.

That will directly map to:

* getRegNumber → header appears
* condensed → aircraft fills in
* relationships → people animate in

…and it will feel *alive*.
