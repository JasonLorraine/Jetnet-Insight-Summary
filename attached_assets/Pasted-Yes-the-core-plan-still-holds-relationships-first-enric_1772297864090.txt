Yes — the **core plan still holds** (relationships-first enrichment + broker-first surfacing). Based on what I can actually see in your latest repo history, your recent changes look directionally good, but they **don’t replace** the need for `getRelationships` as the enrichment backbone.

### What changed in your latest pass (and why it matters)

1. **You added broker actions (call / text / email) to contacts.**
   That’s exactly aligned with the “broker usefulness” goal. You updated `ContactRow` and adjusted the profile builder to separate mobile vs office, plus prefilling messaging context. ([GitHub][1])

2. **You removed sensitive debug logging (REG + ACID) from the flight flow.**
   Also correct — that was PII-ish and would leak broker lookups into logs. ([GitHub][2])

So: **UI/UX for outreach is moving the right way.** Your *data* still needs the relationships layer to be complete.

---

## What I’d add on this pass (high leverage)

### 1) Stop treating “Key Contacts” as a single source

Right now your “Key Contacts” concept appears to be fed from whatever the profile builder returns (likely owner-ish). That’s fine as a first view, but brokers need:

* **Owner**
* **Operator**
* **Manager**
* **Finance/Admin**
* **Aviation department**
* **Scheduler/dispatch (often the fastest intel)**

`getRelationships` is the endpoint that makes that possible.

**Add:** “Top Contacts” should be a *ranked slice* of the relationship graph, not a flat list.

---

### 2) Add role + relationship badge everywhere you show a person

A contact row should always show a compact badge like:

* **Owner Rep**
* **Operator**
* **Management**
* **DOM**
* **Chief Pilot**
* **Scheduler**
* **Controller / CFO**

Because brokers don’t contact “people”, they contact **roles**.

---

### 3) Dedup + merge contacts across roles

Same `CONTACTID` will show up multiple times across roles/companies.

**Rule:** merge into one “Contact Card”, show multiple badges, and compute a combined score.

---

### 4) Add a “Contact Pack” export (killer broker feature)

One tap: **Copy Contact Pack**
Copies a clean block of text:

* Aircraft / tail
* Top companies (Owner/Operator/Manager)
* Top contacts with email + mobile + role badges

Brokers paste this into email/CRM instantly.

---

### 5) Add a broker-safe fallback when contact fields are missing

If you have:

* no mobile → hide text button
* no email → hide email button
* only office → call still works

No red error states. Just “Not available”.

---

### 6) Cache relationships 24–72 hours

Relationships are not flight-activity volatile.

Cache key by `ACID`:

* `relationships:{acid}` TTL 24h
  Add a manual **Refresh** button if you want.

---

### 7) Add a “People” tab, not just a section

Once `getRelationships` is in:

* **People (ranked)**
* **Companies**
* **Graph (optional)**

Your app becomes a broker tool instead of a profile viewer.

---

## What I *couldn’t* verify from the repo

GitHub’s file viewer content didn’t render cleanly via my tooling for the current `main` branch, so I **could not confirm** whether you’ve already wired `POST /api/Aircraft/getRelationships/{{apiToken}}` into the runtime flow, or whether your current contacts are still derived from a different endpoint. I *can* confirm the commits that added contact actions and removed sensitive logs. ([GitHub][1])

---

## The 2-point “still holds true” verdict

✅ **Yes**: The plan (relationships-first enrichment + outreach-first UI) is still the right architecture.
✅ **Yes**: Your latest pass improved broker actions and reduced logging risk. ([GitHub][3])

If you want me to do a real code-level confirmation: paste the current `server/routes.ts` relationship route (or wherever you’re calling JETNET endpoints) and the function that builds `profile.contacts`. I’ll tell you exactly what to change, line-by-line, to make `getRelationships` the enrichment source and to add ranking/badges/dedup correctly.
