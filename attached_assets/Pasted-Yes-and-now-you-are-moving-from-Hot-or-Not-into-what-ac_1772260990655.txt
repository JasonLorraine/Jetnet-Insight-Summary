Yes — and now you are moving from **“Hot or Not”** into what actually becomes powerful:

> a **Disposition Intelligence Skill**
> (not just aircraft scoring, but *seller behavior prediction*).

What you’re describing is exactly what brokers intuitively do in their heads. We just need to formalize it into deterministic signals the AI can explain.

Below is the upgraded **Skill Design v2** that your engineer can implement directly.

---

# HOT OR NOT → DISPOSITION INTELLIGENCE SKILL (v2)

## Expanded Goal

Rate the aircraft **AND** answer:

* How long has the owner held it?
* What type of owner are they?
* Are they likely approaching replacement cycle?
* When are they statistically likely to sell?
* Is this a proactive outreach opportunity?

This becomes a **lead-generation engine**, not just analysis.

---

# 1. NEW DATA DIMENSIONS (Added to Profile)

Your `AircraftProfile` normalization layer must now include:

### Ownership Timeline

Derived from transaction history.

Fields:

```
purchaseDate
ownershipLengthDays
ownershipLengthYears
previousOwnersCount
ownershipSequenceNumber
```

How:

* Use transaction history endpoint
* Find last “Full Sale”
* Calculate:

```text
ownershipLength = today - purchaseDate
```

---

### Owner History (Critical)

Build owner behavior profile:

```
ownerCompanyId
fleetSize
priorAircraftOwned[]
avgOwnershipDuration
upgradePattern
brandHistory[]
```

This is where JETNET becomes uniquely powerful.

---

### Brand Loyalty Index

Measure how consistently an owner stays with OEM.

Example logic:

```
Brand Loyalty Score =
(# aircraft same OEM historically) /
(total aircraft owned)
```

Outputs:

* HIGH (≥70%)
* MODERATE
* LOW / Opportunistic

Why brokers care:

* Gulfstream owner likely upgrades Gulfstream.
* Citation owner rarely jumps directly to Global.

---

### Replacement Cycle Signal

Most owners follow patterns:

| Segment          | Typical Hold |
| ---------------- | ------------ |
| Light Jet        | 4–7 yrs      |
| Mid              | 5–8 yrs      |
| Large Cabin      | 7–12 yrs     |
| Ultra Long Range | 8–15 yrs     |

Compute:

```
cycleRatio =
ownershipLength /
expectedOwnershipCycle(modelCategory)
```

Interpretation:

* <0.6 → early ownership
* 0.6–1.0 → watch zone
* > 1.0 → replacement window

# 2. OWNER DISPOSITION SCORE (NEW)

Add second score alongside Hot/Not.

## Owner Sell Probability (0–100)

### Factors

#### A. Ownership Age vs Cycle — 30 pts

Most predictive variable.

#### B. Historical Upgrade Behavior — 20 pts

Owner sells regularly → high probability.

#### C. Fleet Expansion/Reduction — 15 pts

Fleet shrink often precedes sale.

#### D. Brand Loyalty Upgrade Path — 15 pts

OEM launches trigger upgrades.

#### E. Utilization Trend — 10 pts

Declining use often precedes listing.

#### F. Market Timing Alignment — 10 pts

Strong market increases likelihood of selling.

---

### Output

```
sellProbability: 74
sellWindowEstimate: "9–18 months"
confidence: 0.81
```

---

# 3. OWNER HISTORY PANEL (UI + MCP OUTPUT)

Add new section:

## Owner Intelligence

Show:

* Purchase date
* Length of ownership
* Previous aircraft owned
* Average hold time
* Brand loyalty indicator
* Upgrade pattern

Example MCP output:

```json
{
  "ownerIntelligence": {
    "purchaseDate": "2018-06-12",
    "ownershipYears": 7.4,
    "avgOwnershipYears": 6.8,
    "brandLoyalty": "HIGH",
    "priorAircraft": ["G450", "G550"],
    "upgradePattern": "Incremental OEM upgrades",
    "sellProbability": 74,
    "predictedSellWindow": "9–18 months"
  }
}
```

---

# 4. PICTURES (YES — but strategically)

Pictures are not cosmetic.

They influence perceived sellability.

### Add Image Signals

From picture endpoint:

Compute:

* imageCount
* recency (if metadata exists)
* interior/exterior presence

Signal:

```
listingReadinessScore
```

Aircraft with professional imagery historically sell faster.

Add small boost to Hot score.

---

# 5. PREDICTIVE SELL MODEL (Important Philosophy)

This is NOT ML initially.

Start deterministic.

Prediction formula:

```
Sell Probability =
(OwnershipCycleScore * 0.35)
+ (OwnerBehaviorScore * 0.25)
+ (UtilizationTrend * 0.15)
+ (MarketStrength * 0.15)
+ (BrandUpgradePressure * 0.10)
```

LLM explains prediction.
Math produces prediction.

---

# 6. NEW MCP TOOL

## Tool

`predict_owner_disposition`

### Input

```json
{
  "registration": "N123AB"
}
```

### Output

```json
{
  "sellProbability": 74,
  "predictedWindowMonths": [9,18],
  "ownershipCycleStatus": "Replacement Window",
  "brandUpgradeLikelihood": "High",
  "confidence": 0.81,
  "explanationFactors": []
}
```

---

# 7. Updated HOT/NOT Meaning

Hot/Not now becomes:

### HOT = Easy to Sell

### SELL SIGNAL = Likely to Enter Market Soon

Together they answer:

> “Should I call this owner today?”

That is enormously valuable.

---

# 8. Why This Is Extremely Powerful (Strategically)

You are now combining:

* Aircraft liquidity
* Owner psychology
* Historical behavior
* Market timing

No competitor exposes this unified signal.

Most tools answer:

> “What is this aircraft?”

You answer:

> “What will happen next?”

---

# 9. The Next Step I Recommend (Very Important)

Before engineers build:

We should define the **Owner Archetypes** your AI will classify automatically:

Examples:

* Serial Upgrader
* Long-Term Holder
* Opportunistic Seller
* Corporate Fleet Optimizer
* Lifestyle Owner

This becomes the language brokers immediately understand.

If you want, I’ll design that classification system next — it will massively improve adoption because brokers will trust it instantly.
