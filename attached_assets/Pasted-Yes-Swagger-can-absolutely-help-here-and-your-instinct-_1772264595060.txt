Yes — Swagger can absolutely help here, and your instinct is right: for “full spec detail,” you typically do a two-step:

resolve the aircraft ID (ACID) from the reg number, then

pull the full aircraft object (the “specs” payload) using getAircraft() (or the bulk version).

The clean pattern

A. Tail number → ACID

Use an endpoint that searches by registration (commonly “get by regnbr” or an aircraft list filter by regnbr).

Result should include ACID (and often ModelID too).

B. ACID → full aircraft/spec object

Call getAircraft() for the full aircraft object (this is the one you want for “full specs”).

If you’re loading multiple aircraft at once, there’s also a bulk version added in 2025 that returns “the same functionality as getAircraft()” but takes an aclist.

So in your app: getRegNbr → (ACID) → getAircraft is the right mental model.

The Evolution link issue: you do need a security token for direct page calls

Your raw link:

https://evolution.jetnet.com/aircraft/25062

…is not the supported deep-link pattern for embedding/jumping into Evolution from another app.

JETNET’s own guidance: some API responses include a pageurl you can use, and Evolution detail pages require the security token as a URL parameter for that type of “direct page call.”

Example aircraft page format they publish:

https://www.jetnetevolution.com/DisplayAircraftDetail.aspx?acid=[ACID]&securityToken=[TOKEN]

What you should do in Jetnet-Insight-Summary

Do not hardcode https://evolution.jetnet.com/aircraft/{id}.

Instead:

Prefer the pageurl returned by your getAircraft / getCompany / getContact calls (when present).

Or construct the URL in the published format using ACID + your securityToken.

What to change in your workflow (practical)

In the “Hot or Not” detail page loader:

Call registration search → capture ACID

Call getAircraft(ACID) → use that payload for full specs

For “Open in Evolution” button:

Use returned pageurl, or build DisplayAircraftDetail.aspx?...&securityToken=...
