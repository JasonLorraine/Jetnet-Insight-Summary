Good question — because **MCP on a phone is not obvious until you think of it as “your aviation data becoming a native capability inside AI,” not just inside your app.**

Let’s separate what MCP *actually* gives you versus what a normal mobile app already does.

---

# What MCP on your phone gives you

## 1. Your app stops being just an app

It becomes a **data capability any AI can use**.

Without MCP:

* User opens *Hot or Not*
* Types tail number
* Gets result
* Leaves app

With MCP:

* The phone’s AI (Claude, GPT, future Apple Intelligence agents, etc.) can call:

```
hot_or_not_by_registration("N123AB")
```

directly.

Meaning the workflow becomes:

> “Hey Claude, is N123AB a good acquisition target?”

…and your MCP server runs the JETNET workflow behind the scenes.

Your product becomes **infrastructure**, not UI.

---

## 2. You move from “mobile app” → “aviation intelligence layer”

Right now:

* Users must remember to open your app.

With MCP:

* The AI opens *you* automatically when aviation context appears.

Examples:

### Example A — Broker texting a client

User asks AI:

> “Summarize this aircraft and tell me if it will sell quickly.”

AI:

1. Detects tail number
2. Calls your MCP tool
3. Returns Hot/Not + broker summary

Your system becomes invisible but essential.

---

## 3. Cross-app intelligence (this is the real unlock)

MCP allows AI to combine tools.

Example on a phone:

User:

> “Compare N123AB with similar aircraft currently for sale and draft outreach.”

AI workflow:

1. Calls your MCP:

   * aircraft profile
   * market signals
   * hot/not score
2. Calls email/calendar tools
3. Produces broker-ready outreach

Your MCP becomes part of a **multi-tool reasoning chain**.

Your competitors’ apps cannot do this.

---

## 4. Zero UI dependency (huge for adoption)

Most brokers will never install another aviation app.

But they WILL use:

* Claude mobile
* ChatGPT mobile
* Apple Intelligence
* future CRM copilots

If MCP exists:
👉 they already have your product.

---

## 5. Natural language replaces navigation

Instead of:

```
Login → Search → Tabs → Analyze → Think
```

User says:

> “Is this jet liquid in today’s market?”

Your MCP tools provide:

* structured data
* scoring
* summary

AI handles interaction.

You become the **data brain**, not the interface.

---

## 6. Your moat becomes stronger

Anyone can build:

* a tail lookup app
* dashboards
* reports

Very few will build:

* deterministic scoring
* normalized aviation ontology
* MCP tools trusted by agents

Once agents rely on your tools, switching costs become massive.

---

# What MCP specifically enables on mobile (practical)

### Today (near-term)

* Claude mobile connects to your MCP server
* User queries aviation naturally
* Your backend executes JETNET workflows

### Soon

* AI reads tail numbers from:

  * emails
  * PDFs
  * screenshots
  * iMessages
* Automatically calls your tools

### Future (Apple direction)

Apple Intelligence-style agents:

* detect aviation context
* call MCP tools silently
* show results inline in iOS

Your backend becomes a **system extension**.

---

# The mental model

Your mobile app = **Dashboard**

Your MCP server = **Operating System plugin for aviation intelligence**

The dashboard attracts users.
The MCP layer makes you unavoidable.

---

# Why this matters specifically for *you* (JETNET context)

You already have:

* Golden Path workflow
* aircraft → company → behavior → signal → action model
* deterministic aviation expertise

MCP turns that into:

> “Ask AI anything about a jet” → powered by JETNET logic.

That is dramatically bigger than a mobile app.

---

# What MCP on the phone does NOT do

Important expectations:

❌ It does not replace your mobile UI
❌ It does not store data locally
❌ It does not eliminate backend work
❌ It does not give you distribution automatically

It gives you **AI interoperability**.

---

# The strategic insight (this is the big one)

Your app is how humans discover you.

Your MCP server is how AI depends on you.

And long-term, AI will be the primary interface.

If you want, next I can show you something extremely practical:

👉 **The exact moment a broker would feel “wow” using this on their phone**
(a real 30-second workflow that sells the entire product instantly).
