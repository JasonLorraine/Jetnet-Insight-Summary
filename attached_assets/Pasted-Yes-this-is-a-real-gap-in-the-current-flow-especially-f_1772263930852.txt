Yes — this is a **real gap** in the current flow, especially for what you’re trying to accomplish with *Hot or Not / Insight Summary*. Right now the app evaluates an **aircraft**, but buyers, brokers, and OEM salespeople actually evaluate a **relationship graph**:

> Aircraft → Company → Contacts → Decision Makers → Behavior

So adding Company + Contact as a first-class surface is the correct move — not just extra data.

Below is a clean implementation approach that will fit your existing repo architecture and feel intentional rather than bolted on.

# ✅ Recommended UX: Add a “Ownership” Tab (not just data fields)

Do **not** bury this inside aircraft details.

Create a top-level tab:

```
[ Overview ] [ Ownership ] [ Activity ] [ Market ] [ Prediction ]
```

### Why “Ownership” instead of “Company”?

Because users mentally ask:

> “Who actually controls this airplane?”

Ownership communicates value immediately.

# 🧭 Ownership Tab Layout (Apple-level clarity)

## Section 1 — Operating Entity (Company Card)

Large summary card at top.

**Display:**

* Company Name
* Operator vs Owner badge
* Company Type (Corp / LLC / Fractional / Charter)
* Headquarters (City, State, Country)
* Fleet Size
* Industry (if available)
* Years owning aircraft
* Brand loyalty indicator

Example:

```
CM SR Aviation LLC
Operator | Private LLC
📍 White Plains, NY
Fleet: 3 Aircraft
JETNET Relationship Score: High
Ownership Duration: 6.2 yrs
```

---

## Section 2 — Fleet Context (Mini Fleet Strip)

Horizontal scroll cards:

```
[G650ER]  [CJ3+]  [PC-12]
Owned since 2021
```

Purpose:
Users instantly understand sophistication level.

---

## Section 3 — Key Contacts (THIS is the money)

Card list:

| Name       | Title             | Role Signal         |
| ---------- | ----------------- | ------------------- |
| John Smith | Director Aviation | Decision Maker      |
| Sarah Lee  | Chief Pilot       | Influencer          |
| Mike Brown | CFO               | Financial Authority |

Add icons:

* 🟢 decision maker
* 🟡 influencer
* 🔵 operational

---

## Section 4 — Relationship Intelligence (NEW VALUE)

Derived insights (AI generated):

* Likely upgrade window: 12–24 months
* Historical ownership pattern: trades every ~6 years
* Brand preference: Gulfstream-heavy
* Broker interaction likelihood: High

This becomes your differentiator vs raw databases.

# ⚙️ Backend Workflow (How Data Loads)

When user enters tail number:

### Step 1 — Aircraft loads

```
getAircraftByRegNbr
```

Extract:

```
ACID
COMPANYID
```

---

### Step 2 — Company auto-fetch

```
GET /api/Company/getCompanyList
Body:
{
  "companyid": COMPANYID
}
```

Cache immediately.

---

### Step 3 — Contacts fetch

```
GET /api/Contact/getContactList
Body:
{
  "companyid": COMPANYID
}
```

---

### Step 4 — Relationship Mapping (important)

Use:

* RELATIONSHIP
* CONTACTID
* COMPANYID
* ACID

Build internal graph object:

```ts
ownershipProfile = {
  aircraft,
  company,
  contacts,
  relationships
}
```

# 🎨 UI Behavior (Johnny-Ive Approved)

## Progressive Fill Loading

Ownership tab should **assemble itself**:

1. Company card fades in
2. Fleet cards slide left → right
3. Contacts populate one-by-one
4. AI insight text types in slowly

Feels intelligent, not database-y.

# 🤖 AI Skill Upgrade (What Your Rating Engine Gains)

Your scoring model should now include:

| Factor             | Signal                  |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Fleet size         | sophistication          |
| Ownership duration | sell timing             |
| Contact seniority  | deal velocity           |
| Brand loyalty      | OEM targeting           |
| Company growth     | acquisition probability |

This dramatically improves prediction accuracy.

---

# ⭐ Hidden Power Move (You should absolutely add this)

Add button:

```
[ Open in Evolution → ]
```

Deep link using:

```
COMPANYID or ACID
```

Now your app becomes a **front door** to Evolution, not a replacement.

JETNET leadership will love this positioning.

---

# 🧠 What You Were Missing (Strategically)

Right now your app answers:

> “Is this airplane interesting?”

After this change it answers:

> “Is this customer actionable?”

That’s a sales intelligence product.

---

If you want next, I can design the **exact scoring logic** that merges Aircraft + Company + Contact into a single “Hot Score” — this is where the app becomes genuinely addictive for brokers and OEM teams.
