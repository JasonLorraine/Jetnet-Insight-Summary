# Field Map — What it means, who it matters to, and why

This expands the prior mapping by adding:

* **Meaning** (plain English)
* **Who it’s important to** (broker / operator / sales / CRM / compliance / maintenance / analyst)
* **Why it matters** (decision impact)

## Recommended “importance tagging” for the UI

If you want ergonomic display, tag fields by audience:

* **Broker-critical**: `status`, `datepurchased`, `relationships(relationtype/isoperator)`, `avgevalue`, `aftt`, `timesasofdate`, `acimageurl`, base city/state
* **Ops-critical**: `isoperator`, `maintained`, `mxprog`, engines arrays, avionics list
* **CRM-critical**: `COMPID`, `CONTACTID`, `company/contact embedded objects`, `relationtype`, `relationseqno`
* **Compliance-critical**: `regexpiresdate`, damage status, lien/doc fields

If you want, I’ll produce a second version of this table with a final column: **“How it should appear in the UI”** (chip, badge, timeline event, card row, hidden behind “Details”, etc.).
